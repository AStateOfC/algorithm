# Recruiting

I am a researcher at *RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project*, which is a Japanese governmental academic research institute on artificial intelligence related areas. In particular, I am working on discrete algorithms (including topics in this github repository). 

We are hiring programmers and researchers. The criterion is, basically,
- Programmer: having some strong achievements in some competitions (e.g., ICPC, Google Code Jam, CodeForces, etc...).
- Researcher: having some strong publications in some CS area (e.g., SODA/ICALP/IPCO, NIPS/ICML, AAAI/IJCAI, etc...).
If you are interested in, please feel free to contact me.
