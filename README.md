C++ implementations of algorithms
=========

These are my C++ implementations for some (typical) algorithms.
The codes are written for understanding the algorithms,
hence these are not optimized for the performance.
(However, I often use these codes for the research purpose.)

You can use these codes for any purpose,
but I recommend you to "re-implement" the code yourself.
