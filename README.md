C++ implementations of algorithms
=========

These are my C++ implementations for some (typical) algorithms.
The codes are written for understanding the algorithms,
hence these are not optimized for the performance.
(However, I often use these codes for the research purpose.)

These codes are  *public domain*.
You can use them for any purpose.
(I recommend you to "re-implement" the codes for your purpose)
