C++ implementations of algorithms
=========

These are my C++ implementations for some (typical) algorithms.
The codes are written to understand the algorithms.
So these are not optimized for the performance.

You can use these codes for any purpose without warranty,
but I recommend you to "re-implement" the code yourself.
