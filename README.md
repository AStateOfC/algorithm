C++ implementations of algorithms
=========

These codes are my C++ implementations of algorithms, 
which are written for explanating/understanding algorithms.

I publish these codes in *public domain.*
You can use them for any purpose without any warranty.
(but I strongly recommend you to "re-implement" the codes for your purpose.)
